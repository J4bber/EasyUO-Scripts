# EasyUO Scripts
Scripts I have either written or collected that I don't want to loose

Please note these are not all of my creation.  They have been collected over the years from several places.  

Sites you can check to see the originals, if they still exist:

NOTE: Putting here is not considered sharing with others.  This is my personal repo.  If you are pulling from here, you are doing so at your own risk.
